A brief description of the data and code files:

"fig2.csv" : Simulated current-voltage response of RRAM device for 50 cycles.

"fig4.txt" : The values of conductances obtained after programming an RRAM device multilple times using five values of programming currents (25, 45, 65, 85,and 105 Î¼A).

"fig6.txt" : A distribution of high resistance states achieved by cycling the device many times over.

"fig9.py" : A python script that shows the generation of random conductances by choosing different programming currents.

"fig10_30meg.csv, fig10_50meg.csv" : Simulated responses showing the evolution of membrane voltage for two values of the membrane time-constant setting memristor. 

The corresponding python scripts can be run to replicate the figures from the manuscript.
